# Isolated & Deterministic Testing Standards

## 1. Structured & Isolated Test Suites
- Place unit tests verifying individual component logic in `tests/unit/`.
- Place multi-component, end-to-end, or integration workflows in `tests/integration/` or `tests/e2e/`.

## 2. Deterministic & Offline Testing
- Tests must be fast, deterministic, and runnable offline without dependencies on unseeded live cloud services.
- Use explicit test fixtures, hermetic mock harnesses, and deterministic stubs within the test suite.
